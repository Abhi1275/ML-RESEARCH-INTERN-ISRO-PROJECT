# ML-RESEARCH-INTERN-ISRO-PROJECT
At ISRO Project, I developed a deep learning model for hyperspectral unmixing using Chandrayaan-II IIRS data. The project involved separating mixed pixel spectra into pure components (endmembers), optimizing the model, and evaluating results to contribute to lunar surface composition analysis.
